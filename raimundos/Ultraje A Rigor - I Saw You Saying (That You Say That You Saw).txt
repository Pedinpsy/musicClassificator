Reconheci... a Madonna ali parada no jardim
Não resisti... fui perguntar o que ela achava de mim
Eu não sei falar inglês
Ela não entende uma palavra em português

I saw you saying that you said that you saw (I saw you saying)
I saw you saying that you said that you saw (I feel good)
I feel good because you put your butt on me
I feel good because you put your butt on me

Perguntei para o meu pai
O que ela me disse (aah)
Ela disse meu rapaz

I saw you saying that you said that you saw (I saw you saying)
I saw you saying that you said that you saw (I feel good)
I feel good because you put your butt on me
I feel good because you put your butt on me
I feel good because you put your butt on...

The hula hula song make me feel the strong
The hula hula hey goodbye I'm going away
The hula hula song make me feel the strong
The hula hula hey goodbye I'm going away (a há)
Because you put your butt on me (a há)
You know you put your butt on me (a há)
You know you put your butt on me
Shalalala yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
