I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I love
And I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees
and pray that they go away
Still it begins Needles and pins
Because of all my pride The tears
I gotta hide Oh I thought
I was smart I stole her heart
Didn't think I do But now I see
She's worse to him than me Let her go ahead
Take his love instead
And one day she will see just how to save me
And get down on her knees That's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins - oh,
no - oh, no Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong,
I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up and tell myself
I'm strong Because I saw her today
I saw her face It was a face I love
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees
and pray that they go away
Still it begins Needles and pins
Because of all my pride The tears I gotta hide
Hey!
Needles and pins
Needles and pins
Needles and pins
