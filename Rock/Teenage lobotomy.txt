Lobotomy, lobotomy, lobotomy, lobotomy! DDT did a job on me now I am a real sickie guess I'll have to break the news
That I got no mind to lose all the girls are in love with me I'm a teenage lobotomy

Slugs and snails are after me DDT keeps me happy now I guess I'll have to tell 'em
That I got no cerebellum gonna get my Ph.D. I'm a teenage lobotomy

Lobotomy, lobotomy, lobotomy, lobotomy! DDT did a job on me now I am a real sickie guess I'll have to break the news
That I got no mind to lose all the girls are in love with me I'm a teenage lobotomy
